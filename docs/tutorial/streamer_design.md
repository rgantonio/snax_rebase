## TODOs:
- Describe the conceptual need for the streamers
- Introduce the concept of affine address generation
- Describe the detailed block diagram of streamers
  - Describe the main blocks
  - Describe what each module does
- Show the configuration file and demonstrate examples on different configurations leading to different generated architectures
  - Add some thinking exercises for this!
- Timing diagrams at the end
