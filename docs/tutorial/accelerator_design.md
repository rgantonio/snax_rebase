# Accelerator Design

## TODOs:
- Describe the accelerator of interest
- Show a detailed block diagram of the signals
- Mention and describe what the CSR Manager does
- Describe the CSRs to be used
    - Mode: +, -, x, XOR
    - Data length
    - Start
    - Busy
    - Counter
- Have a timing diagram interface to describe what happens for the signals
- Indicate which repository to see this structure
